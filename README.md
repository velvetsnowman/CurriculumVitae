With over 8 years of experience working in the hospitality industry in Australia, England
and France, I have developed strong communication skills and the ability to deliver in a
time-pressured environment. My passion for cuisine was developed over several years
living and studying in ten countries around the world. During my 14 years in Africa, I was exposed to
diverse cultures and social demographics which means I am highly adaptable and able to
collaborate in diverse working groups.

In 2015, I successfully opened a restaurant in Paris, France. To establish the business I negotiated the franchise terms;
documented a detailed business plan to secure funding from an independent bank; identified
a premises and oversaw the conversion from retail shop to restaurant. During the three
years that the restaurant traded I gained first-hand experience at managing and leading a
team.

I have witnessed first-hand the impact of technology on the hospitality industry through
increasing levels of takeaway orders through the expansion of application based services.
Observing the impact of technology on an industry I am passionate about, the hospitality
industry, triggered my interest to better understand technology. I relocated from Paris to
London to attend a 16 week coding boot camp to study software development at Makers
Academy.

## Skills

#### Self-Drive and Leadership 

Having worked for the original Breakfast in America and developed an understating of the business model, I identified an opportunity to launch the first franchised Breakfast in America. Over a period of several months, providing direction and leadership to my lawyer, accountant, project manager, builders and suppliers the franchise was successfully launched.

Opening the restaurant was the initial challenge. Once open I was required to manage, motivate and lead a team of staff to deliver the Breakfast in America experience. Working at a startup is highly challenging as employees are required to perform duties outside of their core role and work long hours. A key aspect of my role was to keep all employees motivated and aligned to the same vision of success by understanding their unique requirements and concerns

#### Project Management

Launching a new restaurant involves multiple independent work streams that all must be delivered to facilitate a successful opening day:
- Identification and appointment of professional services (lawyer & accountant)
- Securing financing and working capital facilities
- identification of a location and property
- Property renovation
- Hiring and training of front of house and back of house staff
- identification and negation with suppliers
- Marketing for the opening day

#### Business Management

Operating as an owner manager I was exposed to all aspects of business management:

- Created a detailed business plan including revenue projections and cash flow expectations to secure external funding
- Identified and negotiated numerous contracts with key suppliers to ensure quality and availability of stock
- Identified and implemented strategies to increase revenue and reduce cost
- Overseeing the completion and payment of government tax returns
- Ongoing monitoring of cash flow and stock to enable the business to operate day to day

#### Hiring and Employee Management

- Identified and hired a lawyer to create the operating company SAS Paris American
Diner
- Identified and hired a Chartered Accountant to manage the financial reporting and
tax requirements of the company
- Successfully hired, onboard and trained 22 employees over a period of 27 months.
- Provided ongoing feedback and development points to staff to ensure standards
were maintained at the expected level

#### Marketing and Communication

Constant advertising to increase revenue and make our product more aware to the public and to increase revenue. Communicated with clients base on new products, deals, and changes. Used a variety of advertising techniques and platforms, from social media to paper-based publicity.

## Personal Achievements

- Owned my first business at 23, a company running a restaurant, focusing on quality american-themed comfort food. My establishment allowed locals and tourists in the heart of Paris to 'walk into America' and fully experience an authentic diner-inspired cuisine and atmosphere.
- A bird's eye view photo of a variety of dishes from my restaurant was used as the homepage background screen of [HungryUp][21]'s first application release. The company later went on to obtain financing to become a top player in the French market, allowing customers to pre-order their drinks and meals online, as well as choose their tables before arriving at the chosen restaurant.
- Collaborated on creating a flyer and mini-booklet for a non-profit organisation in southern-Africa, Zambia, focusing on helping the local population with mental health illnesses get the treatment and care they needed. My effort led to a huge charitable donation from a Danish firm which helped keep the organisation running.
- President's Award for Educational Excellence whilst attending the American International School of Ghana
- Prefect (student leader) for all primary and secondary school classes, as well as House Captain for inter-house sporting competitions at Simba International Secondary School.
- School volleyball and rugby captain as well as MVP at the national Zambian Secondary School rugby tournament.
