With over 8 years of experience working in the hospitality industry in Australia, England
and France, I have developed strong communication skills and the ability to deliver in a
time-pressured environment. My passion for cuisine was developed over several years
living and studying in ten countries around the world. During my 14 years in Africa, I was exposed to
diverse cultures and social demographics which means I am highly adaptable and able to
collaborate in diverse working groups.

In 2015, I successfully opened a restaurant in Paris, France. To establish the business I negotiated the franchise terms;
documented a detailed business plan to secure funding from an independent bank; identified
a premises and oversaw the conversion from retail shop to restaurant. During the three
years that the restaurant traded I gained first-hand experience at managing and leading a
team.

I have witnessed first-hand the impact of technology on the hospitality industry through
increasing levels of takeaway orders through the expansion of application based services.
Observing the impact of technology on an industry I am passionate about, the hospitality
industry, triggered my interest to better understand technology. I relocated from Paris to
London to attend a 16 week coding boot camp to study software development at Makers
Academy.

## Skills

#### Self-Drive and Leadership 

Having worked for the original Breakfast in America and developed an understating of the business model, I identified an opportunity to launch the first franchised Breakfast in America. Over a period of several months, providing direction and leadership to my lawyer, accountant, project manager, builders and suppliers the franchise was successfully launched.

Opening the restaurant was the initial challenge. Once open I was required to manage, motivate and lead a team of staff to deliver the Breakfast in America experience. Working at a startup is highly challenging as employees are required to perform duties outside of their core role and work long hours. A key aspect of my role was to keep all employees motivated and aligned to the same vision of success by understanding their unique requirements and concerns

#### Project Management

Launching a new restaurant involves multiple independent work streams that all must be delivered to facilitate a successful opening day:
